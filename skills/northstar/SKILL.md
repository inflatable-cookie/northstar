name: northstar
description: Use for Northstar docs-spine work in this repo or a consumer project—planning, specs, contracts, roadmaps, research promotion, recovery after drift, ongoing normalization of docs posture, and orchestrator-thread planning/PR review. Invoke automatically for plan, roadmap, contract, spec, research, recover, refocus, sweep, normalize/migrate/setup, or explicit orchestrator-thread language. Handoff or continuation brief only when the user explicitly asks for a handoff, fresh thread, or spin-off—not for bare continue or context limits alone.

# Northstar

Single entry for the Northstar planning and docs system. **Do not** load every
mode up front.

## First step (required)

Open [`references/router.md`](./references/router.md), classify intent, then
open **one** [`references/modes/`](./references/modes/) file and follow it.

| Mode | When |
| --- | --- |
| Handoff | User explicitly wants a continuation brief / fresh thread |
| Orchestrator | User wants question-led planning plus a separate worker/PR loop |
| Normalize docs | Bootstrap, migrate, or keep docs spine healthy over time |
| Research | Evidence → architecture/contracts |
| Recovery | Drifted or changed planning state |
| Planning | Default: plan, promote, compile roadmaps (sub-modes in router) |

Runtime authority comes from the target repo's `AGENTS.md` and local contracts.
When the target is the Northstar source repo, also read
`bundle-docs/protocol-kernel.md`. Its absence is normal in consumer repos and
is not a contract gap by itself.

## Outcomes by mode

- **Planning:** coherent architecture/contracts/roadmaps; no invented system
  behavior; ready cards only when rubric satisfied.
- **Research:** promoted decisions in architecture/contracts, not stranded memos.
- **Recovery:** trustworthy planning surfaces and canonical refs restored.
- **Normalize:** baseline or strict spine installed/maintained; Effigy-first QA.
- **Orchestrator:** question-led planning, one pushed run-file handoff, bounded PR review loop.
- **Handoff:** seven-section brief for another thread (plus any consumer
  trailing headings the target docs policy requires); not a substitute for
  log/roadmap closeout.

## Operator summary (all modes)

Lead with what changed, lane state, next move. Validation only if it failed or
matters. Glue-light internal prose unless the task is public-facing.

## Papercuts loop (required during execution)

- Locate the root of the repository that owns the work and read
  `PAPERCUTS.md` if it exists.
- When a small, solvable execution hurdle appears, append a terse entry to that
  file before continuing. If it is missing, create it without asking the
  operator.
- Capture the friction, impact, plausible fix, and affected surface. Do not
  stop the current task, wait for permission, or fix the papercut unless that
  fix is already in scope.
- Do not log ordinary one-off failures, external blockers, sensitive data, or
  duplicate open entries. Papercuts are observations for later triage, not an
  automatic backlog or roadmap commitment.

The starter file is available at `assets/templates/PAPERCUTS.md`. Seed it on
adopt/upgrade before exact-SHA / clean-tree release prep; do not add it during
tag closeout after a green pinned SHA.

## Refactoring posture

When work touches code or automation: no pre-1.0 compat shims; ask the operator
on breaking changes; from v1.0 preserve expected stable behavior. Follow the
target repo's `docs/contracts/001-working-rules.md` when present. In the
Northstar source repo, expanded doctrine lives at
`bundle-docs/sections/07-delivery-framework-and-autonomy.md`.

## Assets

- Setup/templates: [`assets/templates/`](./assets/templates/)
- Papercuts starter: `assets/templates/PAPERCUTS.md`
- Handoff template: [`assets/templates/northstar-handoff.md.template`](./assets/templates/northstar-handoff.md.template)
- Orchestrator run packet: [`assets/templates/northstar-orchestrator-run.md.template`](./assets/templates/northstar-orchestrator-run.md.template)
- Handoff contract: [`references/handoff-contract.md`](./references/handoff-contract.md)

## Do not

- Skip the router.
- Use handoff mode for compaction-only or ordinary `continue`.
- Start roadmap execution to discover missing contracts.
- Mirror Effigy tasks into `package.json` scripts.
- Alias `tasks.health` to `qa` (doctor orientation must stay cheap; full
  validation is `effigy qa` — see `references/setup/repo-contract.md`).

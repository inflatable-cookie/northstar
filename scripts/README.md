# Scripts

Place repo-owned helper logic here when Effigy does not already cover the job.

Use Effigy from the repo root for the default maintenance loop:

```bash
effigy tasks
effigy doctor
effigy qa
```

## Runtime Policy

- prefer `effigy` when it already covers the operation
- when repo-owned script logic is still needed, default to `TypeScript` run
  with `bun`
- use `bash` only for thin glue or compatibility boundaries
- use `python` or another runtime only with a concrete technical reason

## Working Rule

Scripts remain implementation detail until the helper flow is stable enough to
expose as a first-class Effigy task.

## Problem

State why this repo needs an explicit execution grammar rather than relying on
informal habits.

## Contract

### Delivery grammar

- Material work should follow this chain:
  `vision -> research/specs -> architecture + contracts -> roadmap milestone -> execution -> evidence -> closeout`.
- Use separate contracts for stable seams, important boundaries, or durable
  rules that need their own authority surface.
- Use specs only while shaping material changes; promote durable outcomes into
  architecture and contracts before roadmap execution depends on them.
- Once those outcomes are promoted, treat specs as provisional planning history
  rather than canonical authority; keep, archive, or remove them based on
  whether they still help the active lane.
- A ready batch card should define scope, steps, governing refs, acceptance
  criteria, evidence requirements, stop conditions, and whether
  auto-continuation is allowed.
- In a strict lane, a bare `continue` should resolve through the previous
  closeout's `Next Task`, which should normally point at the current ready card
  or an explicit stop/reassessment step.

### Intent checkpoints

- When planning is needed and the next direction is not clearly determined by
  the current authority surfaces, stop and ask the operator for intent instead
  of inventing the next lane or batch.
- Treat competing plausible directions, milestone handoff choices, and still-open
  product tradeoffs as intent checkpoints rather than routine planning work.
- Do not mark a card `ready` while an unresolved intent checkpoint still
  governs its scope.

### Execution guardrail pack

- prefer real integrated behavior over mockups, placeholders, or token
  scaffolding
- prefer simplicity over decorative or architectural complexity that the
  governing refs do not require
- prefer end-to-end follow-through over convenient partial closure when a batch
  promised a working path
- prefer explicit incompleteness over implied completion when a path is still
  scaffolded or unproven
- treat disconnected gesture work as incomplete unless the batch was explicitly
  scoped as bounded substrate-only work

### Definition of done

- Do not call work done while it is still a mockup, placeholder, or partial
  token implementation.
- Update dependent refs, roadmap state, and logs so they match reality.
- Update any front-door or currentness surfaces that still name the active
  lane, current ready card, or recent evidence chain so they do not keep
  advertising stale authority after closeout.
- Run the required validation commands and record them in a log.
- Name unresolved blockers or limits explicitly instead of hiding them inside a
  completion claim.
- Leave one explicit next task that makes a later bare `continue` unambiguous.

### Operator-facing reporting

- Lead closeout summaries with what changed, what state the lane is now in, and
  what happens next.
- Keep validation and protocol bookkeeping concise and secondary.
- Do not make the operator reconstruct the real outcome from card ids, file
  updates, or long command lists.

### Selective compression

- Use compressed, information-dense writing for internal execution surfaces:
  agent chat, batch cards, roadmap milestones, logs, and internal contracts.
- Remove filler, repetition, and ceremonial transitions.
- Prefer short bullets, fragments, and dense phrasing when clarity survives.
- Do not force this style onto public-facing or teaching docs that need normal
  prose.

### Execution autonomy

- Agents may continue across consecutive ready batch cards without waiting for
  a manual prompt.
- Auto-continuation is allowed only when the cards stay inside the same active
  lane, the governing refs still match, and the prior card's evidence gate
  passed.
- Set a local upper bound for uninterrupted runs, such as a card limit or time
  limit, so autonomy remains bounded.

### Automation runtime policy

- Prefer `effigy` when it already covers the repo operation.
- When repo-owned script logic is still needed, default to `TypeScript` run
  with `bun`.
- Use `bash` only for thin glue or compatibility boundaries that Effigy or
  Bun/TypeScript cannot own cleanly.
- Use `python` or another runtime only when a concrete technical requirement
  justifies it.

### Generation posture

- Treat roadmap generations as substantial sequencing eras, not one-or-two-file
  buckets.
- Keep one generation active across many milestones until the sequencing
  baseline itself needs a reset.

### Stop conditions

- stop on planning gaps, contradictions, or missing authority
- stop when operator intent or prioritization is still unresolved across
  multiple plausible planning directions
- stop when user-facing ambiguity exceeds the project guardrails
- stop when validation fails in a way that changes the plan
- stop when the current card is complete and the next one is not already ready

### Currentness surfaces

- Keep the repo's front-door currentness surfaces aligned to the active lane:
  - `docs/README.md`
  - `docs/contracts/contract-index.md`
  - `docs/roadmaps/README.md`
  - `docs/roadmaps/generation-index.md`
  - `docs/roadmaps/gNN/README.md` for the active generation
  - `docs/specs/README.md` when specs are part of the lane
  - `docs/logs/README.md`
- When a card closes, those surfaces must either:
  - point at the next ready card or active milestone state
  - or explicitly say the lane is awaiting reassessment
- Do not leave a completed card named as the current ready card after closeout.

## Validation

## Planning Notes

Record the practical reason these working rules exist in this repo.

## Next Task
